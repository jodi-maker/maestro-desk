// env.ts validates the environment at module load (`Env.parse(process.env)`)
// and THROWS on missing required vars, which leaves its `env` export
// uninitialized. Several test files import code that transitively loads env.ts,
// so whichever file bun happens to evaluate first must already have these set
// — otherwise the first load throws and every later access fails with
// "Cannot access 'env' before initialization". File order differs by OS
// (local vs CI), so setting them here, before anything loads, makes the suite
// deterministic regardless of order.
//
// All placeholders: the DB connection is lazy (no socket opened) and no test
// hits the network. `||=` so a real value from the environment still wins.
